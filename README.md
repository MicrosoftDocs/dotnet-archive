This repository contains .NET documentation that is no longer maintained. It's
provided so that it's available under an open-source license to allow the
community to move them forward. It's the spiritual sibling of the
[.NET Framework reference source](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource).

Feedback related to content in this repository will not be addressed, as it is
fully retired. That is why this repository is marked as archived and thus
read-only.
