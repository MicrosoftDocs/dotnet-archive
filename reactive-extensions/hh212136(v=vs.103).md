# Observable.Window\<TSource\> Method (IObservable\<TSource\>, TimeSpan, TimeSpan, IScheduler)

Projects each element of an observable sequence into zero or more windows which are produced based on timing information.

**Namespace:**  [System.Reactive.Linq](hh211929\(v=vs.103\).md)  
**Assembly:**  System.Reactive (in System.Reactive.dll)

## Syntax

``` vb

#### Type Parameters

  - TSource  
    The type of source.

#### Parameters

  - source  
    Type: [System.IObservable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd990377)\<TSource\>  
    The source sequence to produce windows over.  

<!-- end list -->

  - timeSpan  
    Type: [System.TimeSpan](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/269ew577)  
    The length of each window.  

<!-- end list -->

  - timeShift  
    Type: [System.TimeSpan](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/269ew577)  
    The interval between creation of consecutive windows.  

<!-- end list -->

  - scheduler  
    Type: [System.Reactive.Concurrency.IScheduler](hh229149\(v=vs.103\).md)  
    The scheduler to run windowing timers on.  

#### Return Value

Type: [System.IObservable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd990377)\<[IObservable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd990377)\<TSource\>\>  
An observable sequence of windows.  

#### Usage Note

In Visual Basic and C\#, you can call this method as an instance method on any object of type [IObservable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd990377)\<TSource\>. When you use instance method syntax to call this method, omit the first parameter. For more information, see [](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Bb384936) or [](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Bb383977).

## Remarks

The Window operator breaks a source sequence into buffered subsets like a windowed view of the sequence. The timeSpan parameter controls how many items are placed in each window buffer by keeping the window open for the duration of that time span. The timeShift parameter indicates the time span, from the beginning of the previous window, which must complete before a new window opens. This shifts the view into the sequence based on the duration of that time span. The scheduler parameter controls where to run the timers associated with the timeSpan and timeShift parameters.

## Examples

In this example the Window operator is used to observe integer sequences from the Interval operator every second.. Each integer sequence is viewed through a window. Each window will be open for 2.5 seconds and then closed. The timeShift parameter is set to 5 seconds . This means a new window will open every 5 seconds from the time each previous window opened. The end result is we have a window open for 2.5 seconds and then closed for 2.5 seconds. So the sequences will include two integers starting from every 5th integer beginning with 0.

          var mainSequence = Observable.Interval(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
    
          TimeSpan timeSpan = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2.5);

          //*** Create a subscription to each window into the main sequence and list the values.      ***//
          //*********************************************************************************************//
    
          Console.WriteLine("Creating the subscription. Press ENTER to exit...\n");
          seqWindowed.Subscribe(seqWindow =>
          {
            Console.WriteLine("\nA new window into the main sequence has been opened\n");
    
            seqWindow.Subscribe(x =>
            {
              Console.WriteLine("Integer : {0}", x);

          });
    
          Console.ReadLine();

The following output was generated by the example code.
