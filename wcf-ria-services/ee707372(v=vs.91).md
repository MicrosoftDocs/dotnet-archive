# How to: Add or Remove a RIA Services Link

\[WCF RIA Services Version 1 Service Pack 2 is compatible with either .NET framework 4 or .NET Framework 4.5, and with either Silverlight 4 or Silverlight 5.\]

This topic describes how to add or remove a WCF RIA Services link between a new Silverlight client application and an existing ASP.NET project.

A RIA Services solution basically consists of client and a server projects that are linked by such a RIA Services link, so adding and removing them is a critical task.

This topic assumes that you have completed the [Walkthrough: Creating a RIA Services Solution](ee707376\(v=vs.91\).md), [Walkthrough: Using the Silverlight Business Application Template](ee707360\(v=vs.91\).md), and [Walkthrough: Creating a RIA Services Class Library](ee707351\(v=vs.91\).md) topics, or have equivalent knowledge and an existing RIA Services solution available.

When you create a new Silverlight Business Application project, you can create a new WCF RIA Services Class Library project, or you can select the **Enable WCF RIA Services** check box in the **New Silverlight Application** dialog box, and a RIA Services link between the client project and the server project is created automatically.

### To add a RIA Services link to an existing solution

1.  Open an existing RIA Services solution.

2.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the Silverlight client project and select **Properties**.
    
    The **Silverlight** tab of the project designer appears.

3.  In the **WCF RIA Services link** drop-down list, select the server project that you want to use for the middle tier with this client project.
