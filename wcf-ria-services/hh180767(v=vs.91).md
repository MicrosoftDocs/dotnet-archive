# Silverlight Navigation Application Template

\[WCF RIA Services Version 1 Service Pack 2 is compatible with either .NET framework 4 or .NET Framework 4.5, and with either Silverlight 4 or Silverlight 5.\]

Use the Silverlight Navigation Application template for projects that require integration and navigation between two or more web pages.

## Silverlight Navigation Application Template

The Silverlight Navigation Application template adds features that implement the Frame and Page controls, URI mapping, Web browser integrated navigation, and browser history integration.

The Silverlight Navigation Application expands on the base Silverlight application template by adding the navigation bar at the top of the page, views for Login, Home, and About pages, and a Styles file. The Styles.xaml, Home.xaml, About.xaml, and Error.xaml files are included by referencing the assemblies listed in the procedure below.

The Silverlight Business Application template adds authentication, roles, and profiles to the Silverlight Navigation Application template, as well as localization. For more information about this template, see the [Silverlight Business Application Template](hh180769\(v=vs.91\).md) topic.

Enabling WCF RIA Services with this template makes the RIA Services programming model available to the user and establishes a RIA Services link between the client and server projects within the RIA Services solution.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The most recent Silverlight SDK and WCF RIA Services Toolkit are required to use this template with RIA Services solutions. For information on installing these prerequisites, see <A href="gg512106(v=vs.91).md">Prerequisites for WCF RIA Services</A>.
