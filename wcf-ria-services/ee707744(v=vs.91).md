# DomainDataSource.CancelSubmit Method

\[WCF RIA Services Version 1 Service Pack 2 is compatible with either .NET framework 4 or .NET Framework 4.5, and with either Silverlight 4 or Silverlight 5.\]

Cancels the current submit operation performed by this [DomainDataSource](ee732901\(v=vs.91\).md), if any.

**Namespace:**  [System.Windows.Controls](ms590941\(v=vs.91\).md)  
**Assembly:**  System.Windows.Controls.DomainServices (in System.Windows.Controls.DomainServices.dll)

## Syntax

``` vb
'Declaration
Public Sub CancelSubmit
```

``` vb
'Usage
Dim instance As DomainDataSource

instance.CancelSubmit()
```

``` csharp
public void CancelSubmit()
```

``` c++
public:
void CancelSubmit()
```

``` fsharp
member CancelSubmit : unit -> unit 
```

``` jscript
public function CancelSubmit()
```

## Remarks

This method will cancel a [SubmitChanges](ee732567\(v=vs.91\).md) operation already in progress. Operations canceled using CancelSubmit will raise a [SubmittedChanges](ee707404\(v=vs.91\).md) event when they complete with the [Cancel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e1bcat2e) flag set to true.

If [IsSubmittingChanges](ee707605\(v=vs.91\).md) is false, this method will not do anything. This method of cancellation differs slightly from canceling a submit by way of the [SubmittingChanges](ee726225\(v=vs.91\).md) event. Upon completion of the operation, check the IsCanceled() dependency property to determine whether the operation was successfully canceled. Note that cancellation of the operation does not guarantee state changes were prevented from happening on the server.
