# WCF RIA Services Templates and Wizards

\[WCF RIA Services Version 1 Service Pack 2 is compatible with either .NET framework 4 or .NET Framework 4.5, and with either Silverlight 4 or Silverlight 5.\]

Visual Studio 2010 provides application and library templates and a domain service wizard to help simplify the development of end-to-end WCF RIA Services applications. The following topics are UI reference topics that describe how to use these user interfaces and what the effects are of using them as a starting point for developing RIA Services applications.
