# Silverlight Application Template

\[WCF RIA Services Version 1 Service Pack 2 is compatible with either .NET framework 4 or .NET Framework 4.5, and with either Silverlight 4 or Silverlight 5.\]

Use the Silverlight Application template for projects that require only a single Web page and do not require any authentication, or when you just want to design everything from the ground up.

## Silverlight Application Template

The Silverlight Application template is the most basic of the Silverlight templates. It contains only the bare minimum files in the Silverlight project and does not include any other features such as a navigation framework or authentication.

The other application templates extend this basic template. The Silverlight navigation Application template adds Frame and Page controls to enable integration and navigation between pages. The Silverlight Business Application template adds authentication, roles, and profiles to the Silverlight Navigation Application template, as well as localization. For more information about this template, see the [Silverlight Navigation Application Template](hh180767\(v=vs.91\).md) and [Silverlight Business Application Template](hh180769\(v=vs.91\).md) topics.

Enabling WCF RIA Services with this template makes the RIA Services programming model available to the user and establishes a RIA Services link between the client and server projects within the RIA Services solution.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The most recent Silverlight SDK and WCF RIA Services Toolkit are required to use this template with RIA Services solutions. For information on installing these prerequisites, see <A href="gg512106(v=vs.91).md">Prerequisites for WCF RIA Services</A>.


For walkthroughs that use this basic template, see the [Walkthrough: Using the Silverlight Business Application Template](ee707360\(v=vs.91\).md) and the [How to: Add Business Logic to the Domain Service](ee796240\(v=vs.91\).md).
