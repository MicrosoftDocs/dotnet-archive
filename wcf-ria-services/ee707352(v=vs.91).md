# ASP.NET Clients

\[WCF RIA Services Version 1 Service Pack 2 is compatible with either .NET framework 4 or .NET Framework 4.5, and with either Silverlight 4 or Silverlight 5.\]

Although the WCF RIA Services framework is intended primarily to be used with Silverlight clients, you can also use it with other clients, such as ASP.NET clients. This approach enables you to use the same middle-tier logic across different types of clients. However, client code is not automatically generated when you use non-Silverlight clients.

The [Walkthrough: Using the Domain Service in ASP.NET Applications](ee807305\(v=vs.91\).md) topic in this section describes how to call the domain services that you exposed in the Web server project for ASP.NET clients.
