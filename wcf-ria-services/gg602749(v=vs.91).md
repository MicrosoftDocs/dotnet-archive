# Accessing non-Silverlight Clients

\[WCF RIA Services Version 1 Service Pack 2 is compatible with either .NET framework 4 or .NET Framework 4.5, and with either Silverlight 4 or Silverlight 5.\]

Although WCF RIA Services is currently optimized to work with a Silverlight client in the sense that is supports the automatic code generation of the Silverlight client proxy, the domain service can be called from other .NET clients such as an ASP.NET client. For details on this scenario, see the [ASP.NET Clients](ee707352\(v=vs.91\).md) and [Walkthrough: Using the Domain Service in ASP.NET Applications](ee807305\(v=vs.91\).md) topics in this section.
