# End-to-EndScenarios

\[WCF RIA Services Version 1 Service Pack 2 is compatible with either .NET framework 4 or .NET Framework 4.5, and with either Silverlight 4 or Silverlight 5.\]

This section contains walkthroughs for a set of common WCF RIA Services end-to-end scenarios.

The first two walkthroughs in this section assume that you have completed the [Walkthrough: Creating a RIA Services Solution](ee707376\(v=vs.91\).md) and continue from the application created with the procedures described there.

The last two walkthroughs in this section assume that you have already created a Silverlight Business Application. The procedure for completing this task is described in the [Walkthrough: Using the Silverlight Business Application Template](ee707360\(v=vs.91\).md).

  - [Walkthrough: Editing Data From a Domain Service](ee707338\(v=vs.91\).md)  
    In this walkthrough, you learn how to create an interface that enables a user to change the displayed data and to save those changes in the data source.
